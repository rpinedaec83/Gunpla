## Session -- 2026-10-23 | Goal: Atlas AI Bootstrap, Legacy Data Audit & CGR (MRD, PRD, ESD) Authoring
Start: 20:11 | End: 20:33 | Duration: 0h 22m

### BOOTSTRAP-1 -- Atlas AI Project Setup, Legacy Preservation & CGR Governance Suite | eMOE: 3 CU | aMOE: 3 CU
What was done:
- Audited existing `gunplajunkies.com` (Node/Express/Sequelize/JWT/Swagger multi-tenant prototype) and `plamoscale.com` (HTML5 UP Multiverse gallery with 4 founding builders `aperich`, `dcampos`, `cluna`, `fog1labs1`, ~92 high-res/thumbnail photos, mission/vision, Mailchimp form, and `bio.txt` links).
- Preserved both existing codebases intact under `docs/reference/preexisting-root/` and registered them in `.atlas/setup.json`.
- Installed the complete `Atlas_AI` kit (`core`, `scaffold`, `cgr`, `ps`, and `uxp-01-modern-app-shell-layout`), initialized git on `main`, and created the remote GitHub repository `https://github.com/rpinedaec83/Gunpla`.
- Authored complete `MRD_GUNPLA_v1.md`, `PRD_GUNPLA_v1.md`, `ESD_GUNPLA_v1.md`, `seed-to-docs-mapping.md`, `MRD-PRD-ESD-TRACEABILITY.md`, `CGR-results.md`, `score.md` (`100/100`), and planned Vertical Slices `DT1`–`DT5` in `docs/agile/devcycle.md`.
Issues hit:
- Found a minor bug in legacy `plamoscale.com/assets/js/script.js` where `aperich` had `1, 4` instead of `14` and photos `17–22` in `images/aperich/` were omitted from the JS array. Documented in `FR6` so the new seed script rescues all 21 photos of `aperich` (~92 total across all 4 builders).
Decisions made:
- Single central API with shared SSO identity (`plamo_sso_token` / Bearer JWT) serving `plamoscale.com` (general scale modeling), `gunplajunkies.com` (Gunpla/Mecha/Sci-Fi), and future B2B white-label club/shop portals.
- Full-Stack TypeScript Monorepo with Vertical Slice Architecture, PostgreSQL + S3-compatible Cloudflare R2 storage, and `x-codec` VPS hosting.
Lessons learned:
- Auditing legacy static assets before setup uncovered 6 additional unpublished photos in `images/aperich/` and community catalog links in `bio.txt` that directly enriched the PRD and seed data plan.
